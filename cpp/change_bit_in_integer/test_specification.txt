Look into file:
   src/unit_tests.c 
In order to see the unit tests, the expectations.

All expectations were met.

Beyond those tests I ran tests to test the bit_position value from main.c
An integer (int datatype) uses 4 bytes, the equivalent of 4*8=32 bits.
Considering the first bit at position 0, the last bit has the maximum
position of 31. Therefore I tried to set the bit_position to 31 and expected
that the program would accept that value. And also set it to 32 and expected
that the program would reject the value. These expectations were also met.

I also tested the interface with the user (stdin, stdout, exit_code) to see
that the application asks for input, prints the messages it should and at the
end it will exit with the appropriate exit code(integer value).
