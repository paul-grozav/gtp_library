<b>PC Tracker</b> helps you track a PC. This service is useful when you have to deal with a computer that receives a new IP each time it connects
to the internet. Using the PC Tracker you will be able to find out the IP of the computer you are tracking.
<br>You can update the IP in our database by accessing this page : <font color="#0000ff"><u>http://1.pe-web.ro/projects/PCTracker/track.php?id=<b>ID</b>&pw=<b>PASSWORD</b></u></font>
<br>When you want to see a computer's IP all you have to do is open this page : <font color="#0000ff"><u>http://1.pe-web.ro/projects/PCTracker/view.php?id=<b>ID</b>&pw=<b>PASSWORD</b></u></font> or <a href="http://1.pe-web.ro/projects/PCTracker/view.php">http://1.pe-web.ro/projects/PCTracker/view.php</a>
<br><b>Note!</b>The IP that we have in our database is the ip that the PC had the last time he accessed our update page. So that if we have the wrong IP it means that the computer did not access our update page or it's turned off.
