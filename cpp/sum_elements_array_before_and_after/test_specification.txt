Look into file:
   src/unit_tests.c 
In order to see the unit tests, the expectations.

All expectations were met.

I also tested the interface with the user (stdin, stdout, exit_code) to see
that the application asks for input, prints the messages it should and at the
end it will exit with the appropriate exit code(integer value).
